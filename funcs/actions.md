title: "actions"

**actions** is an ability of desmos providing interactivity with graphs. the primary usage of actions is to change variables’ values.

## enabling actions

by default, you can’t use actions. if you need to use actions, go to your account settings and enable them. this will allow you to use actions and the [ticker](ticker).

## usage

the simplest action syntax is this: \\(\text{variable}\to\text{value}\\). to type the right arrow, type `->` (minus and greater-than). desmos will understand that and automatically convert it to the right character.

when you type an action into the expression bar, you’ll see a “->” button. clicking it will execute your action. the example above sets a variable to a new value.
